				<name>Grüner Veltliner Löss 2021 <domain>Schloss Gobelsburg</domain></name>
				<caseprice>94.24</caseprice>
				<description>
					The Grüner Veltliner is Austria’s prime grape variety, producing dry,
					fruity wines with an attractive peppery, herbal character. The finest
					examples come from the steep vineyards bordering the Danube and its
					tributaries in the Wachau, Kremstal and Kamptal regions west of
					Vienna. The lighter ‘Federspiel’ style of this wine makes for a
					perfect aperitif and pairs well with light chicken or fish dishes (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

			<wine>
				<name>Grüner Veltliner Weinzierlberg 2020 <domain>Stadt Krems</domain></name>
				<caseprice>113.28</caseprice>
				<description>
					Austria’s Grüner Veltliner grape produces a variety of wine styles, from
					simple, light quaffing wines to rich, multi-faceted wines rivalling many
					top white Burgundies in quality, yet without the high pricetag.  This zestful wine
					with its delightful white peach flavours belongs to the latter
					category and has the added benefit of being enjoyable young and for up to five years.  It’s
					a perfect choice for poached trout or salmon, but has enough flavour concentration to match
					grilled chicken, veal or pork (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>

				<name>Riesling Steinterrassen 2020 <domain>Stadt Krems</domain></name>
				<caseprice>113.28</caseprice>
				<description>
					The boyish-looking <person>Fritz Miesbauer</person> propelled the Austrian
					co-operative Freie Weingärtner Wachau to fame in the 1990s and has now
					made his mark at Stadt Krems in neighbouring Kremstal.  His Riesling
					Steinterrassen, with its lovely perfumed nose and bone dry, crunchy, green apple
					flavours is a brilliant example of his wizardry – gorgeous now but
					promising more complexity and a long life ahead (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<name>Sauvignon Blanc 2021 <domain>Rapaura Springs</domain></name>
				<caseprice>98.72</caseprice>
				<description>
					Sauvignon Blanc has become the signature wine grape of New Zealand, and this
					tasty example, with its combination of zingy
					acidity and intense aromas and flavours of limes, greengages and
					elderflower – shows why. It’s delicious, with none of that nasty tinned-asparagus
					character that spoils so many others (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
			<wine>
				<name>Premium Sauvignon Blanc 2020 <domain>Vergelegen</domain></name>
				<caseprice>83.60</caseprice>
				<description>
					During my visit to South Africa in 2015 I tasted many Sauvignon Blancs and Vergelegen’s was among my top picks. The 2020 offers
					seductive lime blossom, gooseberry and passion fruit aromas and an elegant balance of fresh acidity and ripe fruit flavours. It makes
					a delicious aperitif or partner to vegetarian dishes as well as steamed or baked fish and chicken (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
			
			<wine>
        <name>Petit Chablis 2019 <domain>Domaine Billaud-Simon</domain></name>
				<caseprice>177.92</caseprice>
				<description>
					It’s rare that a ‘Petit Chablis’ makes an impression, but this wine from <person>Bernard Billaud</person>
					always stands out in comparative tastings. Its unoaked, pure, lemony character combined with zingy acidity and minerality would give many more
					expensive Chablis a run for their money (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
			<wine>
        <name>Chablis 2019 <domain>Domaine Billaud-Simon</domain></name>
				<caseprice>203.25</caseprice>
				<description>
					This is textbook Chablis from one of my favourite producers and an excellent vintage. It combines tingling acidity with appetising citrus, 
					white peach and green apple flavours. Delicious now, it will reward cellaring for another five years or longer (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>

			<wine>
				<name>Saint Véran ‘Les Pierres Blanches’ 2020 <domain>Cave de Prissé</domain></name>
				<caseprice>140.32</caseprice>
				<description>
					The impressive Cave de Prissé in the Mâcon region of southern Burgundy is the area’s foremost producer of Saint Véran,
					and ‘Les Pierres Blanches’ has been providing remarkably consistent enjoyment at very
					reasonable prices year on year for as long as I can remember. Fresh, delicious, and easy-drinking, it provides a satisfying mouthful of 
					bright, apply fruit (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
				<wine>
				<name>Saint Véran  2020 <domain>Domaine Saumaize-Michelin</domain></name>
				<caseprice>177.65</caseprice>
				<description>
					Many of the best producers of Saint Véran are now making wines that rival those 
					of their more renowned and highly-priced neighbour, Pouilly-Fuissé.
					This delightful wine combines aromatic notes of buttery toast and fresh pears
					with refreshing acidity and rich, lingering flavours (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

      			<name>Chardonnay Grand Ardèche 2019 <domain>Louis Latour</domain></name>
				<caseprice>126.05</caseprice>
				<description>
					<person>Jancis Robinson</person>, <acronym title="Master of Wine">MW</acronym>
					colleague and wine writer, described this elegant, subtly oaked
					Chardonnay from the Ardèche as the ‘best value by far’ in a tasting of
					top international Chardonnays. Delicious now, it has enough structure
					and concentration to age for another 3-5 years or more.  I’m still enjoying the
					2016 vintage (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
     
			<wine>
				<name>Reserve Chardonnay 2019 <domain>Vergelegen</domain></name>
				<caseprice>143.47</caseprice>
				<description>
					Wines from South Africa tend to lie somewhere between the rich, ripe styles of New World wines and the 
					more subtle styles of the Old World. Vergelegen’s elegant Reserve Chardonnay combines smoky tropical aromas and flavours of
					orange blossom, white peach and pineapple with a measured hint of buttered toast. It would be a perfect match for crab, trout, smoked salmon, crayfish or 
					lobster (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>

			<wine>
				<name>Kim Crawford Pinot Gris 2021</name>
				<caseprice>146.72</caseprice>
				<description>
					I visited <person>Kim Crawford</person>’s winery in Marlborough on my trip to New Zealand in 2005 and was captivated by this wine, with its rich, almost savoury character and silky texture. Pinot Gris is rapidly gaining a reputation for quality
					 in New Zealand, and this is one of the tastiest examples I’ve come across, and makes a delightful aperiif but has enough body and concentration to partner pork, ham or <phrase lang="fr">charcuterie</phrase> (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

			  <name>Falerio 2020 <domain>Saladini Pilastri</domain></name>
	        <caseprice>63.20</caseprice>
	        <description>
	          This tasty blend of Trebbiano, Passerina and Pecorino grapes comes
	          from the 300 year-old organic estate of <person>Count Saladini Pilastri</person> in The Marche region
	          of northeast Italy.  I love its crisp apple and pear flavours and would happily drink
	          it with lighter fare like <phrase lang="it">risotto</phrase> with prawns,
	          roast cod, or guinea fowl (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<name>Lugana 2020 <domain>Nunzio Ghiraldi</domain></name>
				<caseprice>104.32</caseprice>
				<description>
					Trebbiano di Lugana is actually the Verdicchio grape, and is responsible for some
					remarkable wines in vineyards near the shores of Lake Garda in Lombardia.
					In the hands of the Harley-driving <person>Nunzio Ghiraldi</person> it produces lovely, complex
					wines with hints of stone fruits and gentle herbs. Enjoyable as an aperitif, it
					also makes a worthy partner for seafood, salads and light pasta dishes 
					(<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
			<wine>
				<name>Verdicchio di Matelica 2020 <domain>La Monacesca</domain></name>
				<caseprice>116.64</caseprice>
				<description>
					To people used to the dull Verdicchio of the past, the wines now produced
					from this grape are an exciting revelation. This
					impressive, single-vineyard wine from La Monacesca in the southern Marche
					is a fine example – fresh and richly concentrated, with exciting notes of
					guava and white peaches plus a hint of camomile (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
				</description>
			</wine>
			<wine>
				<name>‘Mirum’ Verdicchio di Matelica Riserva 2018 <domain>La Monacesca</domain></name>
				<caseprice>189.60</caseprice>
				<description>
					On first tasting this extraordinary wine a few years ago, I was bowled over by its richness and complexity. More reminiscent 
					of a fine white Burgundy than a Verdicchio, it offers abundant flavours and aromas of honey, toasted nuts and poached peaches balanced by a 
					refreshing acidity. Try it with rich, creamy dishes like <phrase lang="it">vitello tonato</phrase> or spicy, salty Thai or Chinese fare. 
					It also ages beautifully, gaining complexity over the years (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

			<wine >
				<name>Greco di Tufo ‘Loggia della Terre’ 2020 <domain>Terredora</domain></name>
				<caseprice>132.48</caseprice>
				<description>
					The Greco di Tufo grape is of ancient Greek origin and grows along
					the coastal areas of Campania in Italy, where it has recently gained
					acclaim for its distinctive character. This is a delightful example,
					with intense flavours of melon and quince 
					<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<name>La Segreta Bianco 2021 <domain>Planeta</domain></name>
				<caseprice>96.00</caseprice>
				<description>
					When I first visited this dynamic Sicilian producer in 2004, I found its
					state-of-the-art winery and the quality of its wines most impressive.  Returning
					in May 2012, it was even better.  La Segreta, a blend of indigenous white grape varieties,
					continues to wow me with its intriguing floral
					fragrance and delightful peachy flavours – round, soft and very ‘moreish’
					(<bottleprice/> a bottle)
				</description>
			</wine>
		    <wine>
				<name>Etna Bianco 2020 <domain>Planeta</domain></name>
				<caseprice>184.48</caseprice>
				<description>
					The volcanic slopes of Mount Etna in Sicily are home to this distinctive wine from the
					local Cataratto grape. Pale yellow in colour, it offers aromas of white peaches, yellow plums 
					and summer herbs coupled with a refreshing minerality and a touch of richness from partial barrel fermentation.
					It’s ideal with most seafood and poultry dishes. Try it with crab linguine (<bottleprice/> a bottle)
				</description>

		    <wine>
				<name>Albariño 2020 <domain>Fefiñanes</domain></name>
				<caseprice>156.48</caseprice>
				<description>
					Rias Baixas in northwestern Spain is the home of one of my favourite grapes - the fragrant, stylish Albariño.
					It makes delightful, bone dry, aromatic whites that are completely beguiling, with aromas and flavours of
					white peaches and quince. Fefiñanes makes one of the top examples (<bottleprice/> a bottle). It’s delicious with fresh shellfish and grilled or pan-fried fish.

				<name>Santorini Estate Assyrtiko 2020 <domain>Argyros</domain></name>
				<caseprice>225.76</caseprice>
				<description>
					I visited Greece with a group of fellow Masters of Wine in 2013, and one of
					many highlights was our visit to the beautiful Aegean island of Santorini with its blue-domed,
					whitewashed buildings, dark volcanic soil, and stunning wines from the native Assyrtiko grape.
					This wine is a lovely example of the bone-dry, vibrant, crisp, minerally style of Assyrtiko.
					It’s great on its own but works extremely well with meze, <phrase lang="gr">avgolimono</phrase> soup, grilled chicken and fish
					(<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<caseprice>122.88</caseprice>
				<description>
					<person>Stefano Inama</person>, the dynamic, youthful winemaker at this
					family firm, makes the most delicious Soave I’ve come across. It has unexpected
					aromatic richness and depth of flavour – a pleasure to drink with just about
					anything from <phrase lang="it">bruschetta</phrase> to
					<phrase lang="it">linguine alla vongole</phrase> to pizza with rocket
					and parma ham or gorgonzola cheese (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<description>
					Another great find from my 2015 South African visit was this delicious Chardonnay from
		            Rustenberg in Stellenbosch. I was won over by its elegant apricot and orange-
		            zest flavours and distinctive. moreish style. Try it with seafood or lightly spiced dishes

				<caseprice>232.00</caseprice>
				<description>
					The Timorasso grape, which grows in a remote corner of Piedmont in Italy, was rescued from
					near extinction a few decades ago by the determination and energy of one remarkable man, 
					<person>Walter Massa</person>, who realised its great potential. Today he produces this unique wine from
					10 hectares of grapes grown on the steep slopes of the Colli Tortonesi to the east of Tortona. It offers a distinctive mix of 
					mouth-tingling acidity and a rich, creamy texture with notes of red apples, dried apricots and tangerines. It also ages
					beautifully for up to 15 years, becoming ever more intriguing over time (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<caseprice>172.32</caseprice>
				<description>
					The voluptuous Viognier grape makes deliciously aromatic white wines with notes of honeysuckle, peaches
					and cream in its original habitat of the northern Rhône Valley in France. <person>Yves Cuilleron</person>
					makes some divine but rather pricey Condrieus, and his straight Viognier is nearly as good (<bottleprice/> a
					bottle).

				<description>
					I’ve been looking for ages for a reasonably priced, yet tasty rosé, and this one from organically farmed vineyards in the Camargue
					region of southern France ticks all the boxes. A blend of Grenache Gris and Grenache Noir, it has an attractive pale salmon
					colour and aromas and flavours of white peaches and ripe pears. It’s great as an aperitif or with a variety of fish or chicken dishes as well as spicy Indian or Asian food
					(<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<description>
					Provençal rosés are much in vogue at the moment, and many can be short on depth and flavour. Desite its pale, blush pink colour, this lovely blend of the local Tibouren grape plus Cinsault, Grenache, Mourvèdre and
					Cabernet is bursting with intense aromas and flavours reminiscent of <phrase lang="fr">fraises des bois</phrase> and ripe red fruits. It comes from prime organic vineyards in the heart of Province,
					and has enough structure to enhance most menus from a light <phrase lang="fr"> salade Niçoise</phrase> with grilled tuna to hearty Tuscan <phrase lang="it">porchetta</phrase> (<bottleprice/> a

					<person>Guilhem Durand</person> at Chateau La Bastide in Corbières in

					<person>David Hohnen</person>, the talented Aussie who put Cloudy Bay

				<description>
					A really good example of how Beaujolais can and should taste, this 100%
					Gamay wine is produced organically and bottled without filtration to

				<description>
					Unlike many New Zealand Pinot Noirs, this wine – from vineyards in the warm,
					dry Waipara Valley near Christchurch on the South Island – bears a relatively modest price tag. 
					Yet it packs a big punch in terms of flavour, with vibrant notes of ripe cherries, raspberries,
					blueberries and spicy oak balanced by crisp acidity and soft tannins(<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<description>
					Marqués de Murrieta is one of the two oldest Rioja producers, the other being the Marques de Riscal, and its wines today are better than ever. 
					The 2016 Reserva, a blend of Tempranillo, Mazuelo, Graciano and Garnacha grapes, has been aged for 20 months in American oak and another year
					in bottle before release. It’s drinking beautifully now, showing ripe cherry, blackberrry and plum fruit with a hint of mocha, plus silky tannins and balancing acidity. 
					I’d serve it with most red meat, game birds, and turkey (<bottleprice/> a bottle). It’s also available in 50 cl bottles, perfect for those times when a full bottle
					seems a bit much. Price available on request.

					Named after former winemaker <person>Reginald Merriman Nicholson</person>, this wine is a blend of Shiraz, Merlot and Cabernet Sauvignon. Aging in American and 
					French oak barrels adds a note of toasty spice to its rich flavours of blackcurrants, forest berries, dried herbs and black pepper. Not surprsingly, it has won 
					a host of medals, including double gold at South Africa’s National Wine Challenge in 2016 and Silver at the International Wine Challenge in 2016. Not bad for a wine priced

					A longstanding personal favourite, Rubicon is the flagship of the Meerlust collection,

					was treated to an extensive tasting by winemaker <person>Chris Williams</person>. His Rubicon is
					a Bordeaux-style blend of 80% Cabernet Sauvignon, 20% Merlot, 9% Cabernet Franc and

				<caseprice>202.99</caseprice>
				<description>
					<person>Stéphane Ogier</person> makes sublime wines in the Northern Rhone, an impression that was confirmed when I
					visited his small estate near Ampuis a few years ago. Last year I was treated to a tasting and lunch
					in London, where he presented recent vintages of all his wines. The wines were stunning, but for
					me the best value by far was his La Rosine Syrah, from 30-year-old vines on the edge of the Côte Rôtie appellation –
					juicy, fresh and supple,
					with lingering flavours of violets and dark berries (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<description>
					I’ve long been a fan of <person>André Romero</person>, who makes some of
					the greatest wines in the southern Rhône area.  The American wine critic
					<person>Robert Parker</person> has dubbed him the ‘superstar of
					Rasteau’, and this wine clearly demonstrates why. A blend of Grenache,
					Syrah and Mourvèdre grapes from low-yielding vines, it combines power
					and concentration with enticing aromas and flavours of dark fruits and a
					velvety texture (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<caseprice>140.48</caseprice>
				<description>
					The gifted <person>Stefano Inama</person> has created another amazing
					wine, this one a blend of 60% Carmenère, 30% Merlot and 10%
					Raboso Veronese grown in the volcanic soil of the Colli Berici,
					southeast of Soave Classico.  Fresh and balanced, it has lovely
					damson, black cherry and violet aromas and flavours, very much living
					up to its name, which means ‘more’ in Italian (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<caseprice>158.72</caseprice>
				<description>
					Tenuta di Capezzana is a beautiful estate northwest of Florence dating
					from the time of the Medicis and built around an elegant Renaissance
					palazzo. Its wines have always impressed me, and the quality today is
					better than ever, as shown by the 2014 Barco Reale, with its bright dark
					cherry fruit and juicy yet intense flavours (<bottleprice/> a bottle).

				<description>
					On my first visit to this family-run Tuscan property in 1994, I was
					impressed not only by the quality of the wines and the impeccable new
					winery, but also by the breathtaking views of the surrounding Conca
					D’Oro (‘golden shell’) vineyards at sunset.  I’ve been back regularly
					ever since, and have watched as <person>Giovanni Manetti</person> has
					taken on his late father’s role as winemaker, built a spanking new
					cellar, and continued to improve the quality of the wines.  His 2015
					Chianti Classico is lovely, combining the ripeness of the vintage with a
					luscious, spicy dark-cherry character and a powerful aftertaste (<bottleprice/>
					a bottle).

				<description>
					This amazing wine from <person>Stefano Inama</person> is a blend of
					Cabernet Sauvignon and Carmenère grapes grown on unique
					volcanic soil (‘bradisismo’) in the Colli Berici in Italy’s Veneto
					region.  It combines muscle and elegance with rich blackcurrant fruit
					and spicy complexity from 15 months in new French oak barrels (<bottleprice/> a
					bottle).

					Everyone has a favourite Champagne and this is mine. I love its
					delicate, persistent mousse and fresh, elegant style with its subtle

				<description>
					I first tasted this stylish California sparkler on a visit to the
					Carneros in 1998 and loved its elegant style.  (Not
					surprisingly, as it’s owned by the legendary Louis Roederer Champagne
					house.)  It comes from four vineyards in the cool Anderson Valley north
					of San Francisco, hence the name ‘Quartet’, and makes an impressive,
					yet attractively-priced Champagne substitute – far better value than any cheap
					Champagne at <bottleprice/> a bottle.

				<caseprice>229.25</caseprice>
				<description>
					While the ‘Quartet’ has long been a favourite, it was only on my last visit to Roederer Estate
					in 2018 that I discovered their fantastic sparkling rosé. A classic blend of 60% Pinot Noir and 40% Chardonnay, 
					it has a seductive salmon pink colour, delicate floral, peach and red berry aromas, and crisp acidity. Like its sister 
					wine, it has won countless awards. Enjoy it on its own as a festive aperitif or with light starters and main courses (<bottleprice/> a bottle).
